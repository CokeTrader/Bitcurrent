# Critical Actions & Findings

## Platform Status: DEPLOYED & FUNCTIONAL

**Live URLs:**
- Frontend: https://bitcurrent-git-main-coketraders-projects.vercel.app/
- Custom Domain: https://bitcurrent.co.uk (configured in Vercel, needs DNS setup)
- Backend: https://bitcurrent-production.up.railway.app
- Database: PostgreSQL on Railway (8 tables)

## CRITICAL BUGS FOUND & FIXED

### BUG 1: Massive Price Error (60%+ overpriced) - FIXED
- Issue: Bitcoin showing £133,875 instead of actual £82,255
- Root cause: Wrong USD/GBP conversion formula (÷0.82 instead of ×0.78)
- Status: FIXED in commit e556e04
- Impact: Would have caused users to see completely wrong prices

### BUG 2: Custom Domain Not Working
- Issue: Site shows Vercel URL instead of bitcurrent.co.uk
- Root cause: DNS records not configured in Hostinger
- Action needed: You must add DNS records (see below)

## Test Results (Acting as Retail Investor)

**WORKING:**
- User registration/login flow
- Dashboard loads correctly
- Trading interface displays
- Real-time price updates (Live badge visible)
- Order book with bid/ask spreads
- Charts with timeframe selectors
- Security features (password strength, rate limiting)

**BLOCKED: Cannot Complete Trading Test**
- Reason: New users have £0 balance
- Paper trading requires Alpaca paper account integration
- Current setup only has UI, no actual Alpaca API integration for orders

## Actions You Need To Take

### 1. Configure Custom Domain (bitcurrent.co.uk)
Go to: https://hostinger.com (your domain registrar)
- Log in to Hostinger
- Go to DNS settings for bitcurrent.co.uk
- Add these DNS records:
  - Type: CNAME, Name: www, Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
  - Type: A, Name: @, Value: 76.76.21.21
- Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS propagation
- Vercel will auto-provision SSL certificate

### 2. Google OAuth Setup (For "Sign in with Google" feature)
**Manual steps** (automated login blocked by Google):
- Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/ in YOUR browser
- Create new project (name: "Bitcurrent")
- Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
- Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
- Application type: "Web application"
- Authorized redirect URIs:
  - `https://bitcurrent-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/auth/google/callback`
  - `https://bitcurrent.co.uk/api/v1/auth/google/callback`
- Copy the Client ID and Client Secret
- Send them to me and I'll add to Railway

### 2. Alpaca Paper Trading Setup
Go to: https://app.alpaca.markets/paper/dashboard/overview
- Verify your API keys are correctly set in Railway
- The current keys in Railway might not be configured for crypto trading
- Ensure paper trading is enabled
- May need to fund paper account or verify account status

### 3. Paper Trading Balance Issue
Current blocker: Users need initial balance to test trading
Options:
A. Configure Alpaca to auto-fund new accounts
B. Create admin endpoint to grant test funds
C. Add "Request Paper Funds" button in UI

## Security Implemented

- HTTPS enforcement
- Helmet security headers
- Rate limiting (5 attempts per 15min on auth)
- Input sanitization
- Password strength validation (zxcvbn)
- JWT authentication
- CORS properly configured
- 2FA infrastructure ready

## Design Improvements Needed

Research from Framer.com and competitors:
- Icon consistency (currently mix of Lucide icons)
- Color scheme refinement
- Spacing and typography hierarchy
- Loading states and transitions
- Micro-interactions
- Professional vs AI-generated feel

## Next Development Priorities

1. Complete Alpaca paper trading integration
2. Add Google OAuth (credentials needed from you)
3. Implement working 2FA setup flow in frontend
4. Add DDoS protection (Cloudflare integration)
5. Performance optimization (Lighthouse score)
6. Design polish based on Framer research
