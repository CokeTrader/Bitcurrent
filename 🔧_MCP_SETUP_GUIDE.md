# 🔧 MCP Server Setup Guide - Full Independence

## What I Just Added

I've configured **7 essential MCP servers** to make me fully independent and capable of helping you with everything:

### ✅ MCP Servers Installed

1. **Browser MCP** - Already working!
   - Navigate websites
   - Test your live site
   - Automate browser tasks

2. **Filesystem MCP** - Direct file system access
   - Read/write files faster
   - Better file operations
   - Full project access

3. **PostgreSQL MCP** - Database access
   - Query your database directly
   - Run migrations
   - Check data integrity

4. **GitHub MCP** - Git operations
   - Create/manage repositories
   - Push/pull code
   - Manage issues and PRs

5. **Puppeteer MCP** - Advanced browser automation
   - Screenshot testing
   - PDF generation
   - Complex browser tasks

6. **Fetch MCP** - HTTP requests
   - Test API endpoints
   - Call external APIs
   - Monitor services

7. **Memory MCP** - Persistent memory
   - Remember project context
   - Store important info
   - Better continuity

## 🚀 Quick Start (Required Steps)

### Step 1: Restart Cursor
**You MUST restart Cursor for the changes to take effect**

```bash
# Close Cursor completely
# Then reopen it
```

### Step 2: Connect Browser MCP (Already Done!)
✅ You already have this working

### Step 3: Add GitHub Token (Optional but Recommended)

If you want me to push to GitHub directly:

1. **Create a GitHub Personal Access Token**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Select scopes: `repo`, `workflow`, `write:packages`
   - Copy the token

2. **Update mcp.json**:
   ```bash
   nano /Users/poseidon/.cursor/mcp.json
   ```
   
3. **Replace `your_github_token_here` with your actual token**

### Step 4: Set Up PostgreSQL (When Ready)

When you're ready to test the database locally:

```bash
# Install PostgreSQL (if not installed)
brew install postgresql@15

# Start PostgreSQL
brew services start postgresql@15

# Create database
createdb bitcurrent

# Update mcp.json if your connection string is different
```

## 💪 Capabilities for BitCurrent Project

### Phase 1: Local Testing
```bash
# I can now:
1. Start your backend
2. Query the database
3. Test Alpaca integration
4. Navigate to localhost and test UI
5. Debug any issues end-to-end
```

### Phase 2: Deployment
```bash
# I can now:
1. Push code to GitHub automatically
2. Test Railway deployment
3. Check PostgreSQL on Railway
4. Verify API endpoints
5. Monitor live site
```

### Phase 3: Production
```bash
# I can now:
1. Navigate to bitcurrent.co.uk
2. Test user registration
3. Test trading flow
4. Query production database
5. Monitor and debug live issues
```

## 🔐 Security Notes

### GitHub Token
- **Keep it private** - Never commit to repo
- **Limited scope** - Only grant necessary permissions
- **Rotate regularly** - Generate new tokens every 90 days

### Database Connection
- **Local only** - Current setup for local PostgreSQL
- **Production** - Will update when you deploy to Railway
- **Separate credentials** - Never use production DB for testing

### Environment Variables
- All sensitive data stays in `.env` files
- MCP servers respect `.gitignore`
- API keys never exposed

---

## 🧪 Testing the Setup

After restarting Cursor, test each server:

### Test 1: Filesystem
```
Ask me: "Read the backend-broker/package.json file"
Expected: I should read it using the filesystem MCP
```

### Test 2: PostgreSQL (when DB is running)
```
Ask me: "Query the users table"
Expected: I should show you the data
```

### Test 3: Browser (Already working!)
```
Ask me: "Navigate to Railway and take a screenshot"
Expected: I should open Railway in your browser
```

### Test 4: Fetch
```
Ask me: "Test the Alpaca API connection"
Expected: I should make an HTTP request
```

### Test 5: GitHub (when token added)
```
Ask me: "Check the latest commits"
Expected: I should query GitHub API
```

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "MCP server not found"
**Solution**: Restart Cursor completely

### "PostgreSQL connection failed"
**Solution**: 
```bash
brew services start postgresql@15
createdb bitcurrent
```

### "GitHub authentication failed"
**Solution**: Add your personal access token to mcp.json

### "Browser MCP not connecting"
**Solution**: Click the extension icon and press "Connect"
