## Quick Steps (Follow in Order)

### ☐ Step 1: Sign Up (2 min)
→ Go to: **https://www.cloudflare.com/sign-up**
- Enter email & password

- Log in

### ☐ Step 2: Add Site (2 min)
→ In dashboard: Click **"Add a Site"**

### ☐ Step 3: Review DNS (1 min)
→ Cloudflare shows your DNS records
- Verify records look correct
- Ensure clouds are **ORANGE** (not grey)
- Click: Continue

### ☐ Step 4: Update Nameservers (5 min)
→ Cloudflare shows 2 nameservers (e.g., `angie.ns.cloudflare.com`)

**Write them down!**

Then go to your domain registrar:
- **Namecheap:** Domain List → Manage → Nameservers → Custom DNS
- **GoDaddy:** My Products → Domains → Manage DNS → Nameservers
- **123-reg:** Domain Names → Manage → Nameservers

Paste the 2 Cloudflare nameservers → Save

In Cloudflare: Click "Done, check nameservers"

### ☐ Step 5: Configure SSL (2 min)
→ Don't wait for DNS! Do this now:

In Cloudflare:
1. Click your domain (bitcurrent.co.uk)
2. Go to: **SSL/TLS** (left menu)
3. Select: **"Full"**
4. Go to: **Edge Certificates**
5. Turn ON:
   - ✅ Always Use HTTPS
   - ✅ Automatic HTTPS Rewrites
   - ✅ TLS 1.3

### ☐ Step 6: Wait for DNS (15-45 min)
⏳ **WAITING PERIOD**

Check status:
- Cloudflare will email you when ready
- Or check: https://www.whatsmydns.net/
- Enter: `bitcurrent.co.uk`, Type: NS

When you see Cloudflare nameservers globally → Continue

### ☐ Step 7: Test HTTPS (1 min)
```bash
# Test in terminal
curl -I https://bitcurrent.co.uk
```

Or open in browser: **https://bitcurrent.co.uk**

Should see: 🔒 padlock icon

### ☐ Step 8: Update App URLs (5 min)
```bash
cd /Users/poseidon/Monivo/Bitcurrent/Bitcurrent1
./update-urls-for-production.sh bitcurrent.co.uk
cd frontend && npm run build
# Deploy updated build
```

### ☐ Step 9: Test AI Access
Ask me (Claude):
> "Can you browse https://bitcurrent.co.uk?"

**Expected:** I can access it! ✅
