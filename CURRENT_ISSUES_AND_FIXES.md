# Current Issues and Fixes - Bitcurrent Platform

## Issues Status

### 1. FIXED: Live GBP/USD Exchange Rate âœ…
**Problem**: Bitcoin price calculation was using hardcoded exchange rate (0.78), causing inaccurate pricing.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `/frontend/lib/api/exchange-rate.ts` with live rate fetching
- Uses two free API sources with fallback:
  - Primary: ExchangeRate-API (open.er-api.com)
  - Fallback: Frankfurter API (api.frankfurter.app)
- Caches rate for 1 hour to minimize API calls
- Refreshes automatically every hour
- Integrated into `use-websocket-price.ts` hook

**Status**: COMPLETE - Pushed to Git (commit d79cb2b)

### 2. INVESTIGATING: Railway Backend Crash
**Problem**: Backend returning 502 errors, possibly after Google OAuth integration.

**Next Steps**:
1. Access Railway dashboard and check deployment logs
2. Look for specific error messages in the latest deployment
3. Check if passport.js configuration is causing issues
4. Verify all environment variables are set correctly

**Possible Causes**:
- Missing passport dependencies
- Incorrect Google OAuth callback URL
- Database connection issues
- Missing environment variables

---

### 3. CLARIFIED: Google OAuth Button
**Status**: Google OAuth button IS showing in login page (lines 285-305 of `/frontend/app/auth/login/page.tsx`)

**Current Implementation**:
- "Sign in with Google" button present
- Redirects to: `${NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}/api/v1/auth/google`
- Backend route configured in `/backend-broker/routes/auth.js`
- Passport strategy configured in `/backend-broker/config/passport.js`

**Issue**: Button works but backend is down (502), so OAuth flow is broken

---

### 4. PENDING: DNS/SSL Certificate
**Problem**: `bitcurrent.co.uk` shows SSL certificate error (ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID)

**Cause**: DNS was just configured, Vercel needs 10-15 minutes to provision SSL certificate

**Status**: WAITING - DNS propagation + Vercel SSL provisioning in progress

**Temporary URL**: Use `bitcurrent-git-main-coketraders-projects.vercel.app` until SSL is ready

---

### 5. IN PROGRESS: UI/UX Research

**Completed**:
- Checked Framer templates marketplace
- Web search for crypto exchange UI trends 2024
- Identified Google OAuth integration (already done)

**Next Steps**:
1. Analyze competitor UI/UX (Coinbase, Kraken, Binance)
2. Identify specific improvements for Bitcurrent:
   - Better iconography
   - More fluid animations
   - Improved color scheme
   - Better chart interactions
   - More intuitive navigation
3. Create detailed UI improvement plan

## Critical Priority: Fix Railway Backend

The backend crash is blocking:
- User login/registration
- Google OAuth flow
- All trading functionality
- API endpoints

**Required Action**: 
User needs to log into Railway dashboard so we can:
1. Check deployment logs
2. Identify the crash cause
3. Fix the issue
4. Redeploy

## Summary of Recent Changes

### Commits Today:
1. `d79cb2b` - feat: implement live GBP/USD exchange rate for accurate Bitcoin pricing
   - Added `/frontend/lib/api/exchange-rate.ts`
   - Updated `/frontend/hooks/use-websocket-price.ts`

### Pending Railway Investigation:
- Check if Google OAuth changes broke the backend
- Verify passport.js and passport-google-oauth20 are properly configured
- Review environment variables

---

## Next Actions Required

1. **URGENT**: Access Railway and check backend logs
2. **URGENT**: Fix backend crash and redeploy
3. **WAIT**: Let DNS/SSL propagate (5-10 more minutes)
4. **RESEARCH**: Deep dive into UI/UX improvements
5. **TEST**: Once backend is up, test complete user flow:
   - Register with Google
   - Login with email
   - View real-time prices
   - Place paper trade order
   - Monitor portfolio for 5 minutes
   - Sell order

## Questions to Answer

1. Why did Railway backend crash? (Need logs)
2. Are all passport.js dependencies installed? (Need package.json check)
3. Is DATABASE_URL still correct? (Need Railway env vars check)
4. Are Google OAuth credentials correct? (Need to verify in Railway)
