## How LLMs Can Access Your Website

### For Users Asking ChatGPT/Claude/etc:

Users can now ask questions like:
- "What cryptocurrencies can I trade on BitCurrent?"
- "What are the fees on BitCurrent Exchange?"
- "How do I register on BitCurrent?"
- "Is BitCurrent FCA regulated?"

The LLM can:
1. Access your website directly (if it has browsing capability)
2. Read the structured data at `/api/ai-metadata`
3. Understand your platform through Schema.org markup
4. Reference the ai-readme.txt for quick facts

### For AI Training:

AI companies training their models can:
- Crawl public pages via robots.txt permissions
- Access structured data via sitemap.xml
- Understand context via JSON-LD schema
- Get detailed info from /.well-known/ai.json

---

## Testing LLM Access

### Test with ChatGPT (browsing enabled):
1. Ask: "Browse bitcurrent.exchange and tell me what cryptocurrencies they offer"
2. ChatGPT should be able to access your site and find BTC, ETH, BNB, etc.

### Test with Claude:
1. Ask: "Can you check if bitcurrent.exchange is accessible?"
2. Claude will attempt to fetch the site

### Test robots.txt:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/robots.txt
```

### Test AI metadata:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/ai-metadata
```

### Test sitemap:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml
```

## CORS Configuration

The API metadata endpoint allows CORS from all origins:
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

This means any AI service can fetch your metadata programmatically.

---

## Rate Limiting (Recommended)

Current configuration suggests:
- **1 request per second** for AI crawlers
- **Preferred time:** Off-peak hours (00:00-06:00 UTC)
- **Crawl-delay:** 1 second

You may want to implement server-side rate limiting in production.
