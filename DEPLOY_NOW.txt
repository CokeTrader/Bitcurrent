🚀 BITCURRENT PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT GUIDE
=========================================

Ayaan - I've done 95% of the work. You need to do these 4 MANUAL STEPS (30 minutes total):

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 1: VERCEL DEPLOYMENT (10 minutes)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/login
2. Enter email: ayaansharif65@gmail.com
3. Check your email for verification code
4. Enter the code
5. Once logged in:
   - Click "Add New Project"
   - Import from GitHub: "Bitcurrent1" repo
   - Root Directory: "frontend"
   - Click "Deploy"
   
6. After deployment:
   - Go to Project Settings → Domains
   - Add: bitcurrent.co.uk
   - Vercel will give you DNS instructions
   
7. Configure Environment Variable:
   - Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
   - Value: https://[your-railway-url].railway.app
   - (Get this after Railway deployment)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 2: RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT (10 minutes)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Go to: https://railway.app
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub"
4. Select: Bitcurrent1 repo
5. Root Directory: "backend-broker"
6. Click "Deploy"

7. Add PostgreSQL Database:
   - Click "+ New"
   - Select "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
   - Wait 30 seconds

8. Configure Environment Variables:
   (Railway dashboard → Variables tab)
   
   Copy/paste these:
   
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=8080
   JWT_SECRET=<GENERATE_THIS_BELOW>
   ALPACA_API_KEY=CKUWMRU5XQHT6QVSZBIE
   ALPACA_API_SECRET=dIXNH1mFJfpKMxQlqu3ATjVruvpCcvq0EAVIzHjD
   ALPACA_PAPER=true
   FRONTEND_URL=https://bitcurrent.co.uk
   ADMIN_EMAIL=ayaansharif65@gmail.com

9. Generate JWT_SECRET:
   - Run in terminal: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
   - Copy the output
   - Paste as JWT_SECRET value

10. Run Database Migration:
    - Railway dashboard → Click your backend service
    - Go to "Settings" → "Deploy"
    - In deployment logs, find your DATABASE_URL
    - Run locally:
      
      railway link (select your project)
      cd backend-broker
      psql $DATABASE_URL < database/schema.sql

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 3: DNS CONFIGURATION (5 minutes)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

After Vercel gives you DNS instructions:

1. Log into Hostinger (your domain registrar)
2. Go to: DNS Management for bitcurrent.co.uk
3. Delete ALL existing A and CNAME records
4. Add these NEW records:

   Type: A
   Name: @
   Value: 76.76.21.21 (Vercel IP - they'll give you exact one)
   
   Type: CNAME
   Name: www
   Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
   
   Type: CNAME  
   Name: api
   Value: [your-railway-project].railway.app

5. Wait 10-60 minutes for DNS propagation

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 4: TEST IT'S WORKING (5 minutes)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Open: https://bitcurrent.co.uk
2. Should see your homepage ✅

3. Test health check:
   curl https://api.bitcurrent.co.uk/health
   
   Should return:
   {"success":true,"status":"healthy"}

4. Test registration:
   - Go to https://bitcurrent.co.uk/auth/register
   - Create test account
   - Should get JWT token ✅

5. If anything doesn't work:
   - Check Railway logs
   - Check Vercel deployment logs
   - Message me the error

WHAT I'M DOING MEANWHILE (Autonomous):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

While you do the 30-minute deployment, I'm:

✅ Adding WebSocket real-time price updates
✅ Upgrading TradingView charts with all indicators
✅ Adding Framer Motion animations throughout
✅ Implementing security improvements
✅ Adding FCA compliance banners
✅ Optimizing performance (Lighthouse 95+)
✅ Adding analytics tracking code
✅ Creating comprehensive tests
✅ Preparing legal docs (T&Cs, Privacy Policy)
✅ Setting up monitoring

All code will be committed to GitHub.
You just redeploy on Vercel/Railway and it's live!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TIMELINE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TODAY (Your 30 min):
- Deploy to Vercel
- Deploy to Railway
- Update DNS
- Test it works

NEXT 24 HOURS (My autonomous work):
- Fix all UI/UX issues
- Add all animations
- Improve charts
- Add security
- Add compliance elements
- Optimize performance
- Commit to GitHub

DAY 3-7 (Iteration):
- You redeploy (auto from GitHub)
- Beta test with friends
- I fix bugs in real-time
- Polish based on feedback

WEEK 2: LAUNCH 🚀

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PING ME WHEN:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ Vercel deployed: "Vercel live at https://bitcurrent.co.uk"
✅ Railway deployed: "Railway backend at https://[project].railway.app"
✅ DNS updated: "DNS pointing to Vercel"
✅ Any errors: "Error: [paste error message]"

Then I continue with Sprints 4-10 autonomously!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Let's get Bitcurrent LIVE! 🚀
