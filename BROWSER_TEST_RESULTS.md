## 🚨 If Tests Fail

If the price is still showing **£91,107** or similar inflated values:

1. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   - Chrome: Cmd+Shift+Delete → Clear cached images and files
   - Try incognito mode: Cmd+Shift+N

2. **Check Deployment:**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -1  # Should show: 962bc8e
   curl -I https://bitcurrent.co.uk | grep x-vercel-cache
   ```

3. **Wait for Cache Invalidation:**
   - Vercel cache: Up to 60 seconds
   - Browser cache: Up to 5 minutes
   - Try the preview URL instead: https://bitcurrent-git-main-coketraders-projects.vercel.app/trade/BTC-GBP

4. **Report to Cursor Agent:**
   - What price is displayed?
   - What do console logs show?
   - Screenshot if possible

- Real-time prices may vary by ±£200 due to market fluctuations
- Small differences (<1%) between Binance and CoinGecko are normal
