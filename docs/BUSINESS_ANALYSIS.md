## 📊 Revenue Model

### Primary Revenue Streams

#### 1. Trading Fees (0.25% per trade)
**Our Competitive Advantage:**
- BitCurrent: **0.25%** per trade
- Coinbase: **1.49%** per trade (6x more expensive)
- Binance: **0.10%** (but banned in UK)
- Kraken: **0.26%** (comparable)

**Revenue Calculation:**
```
Revenue per £1000 trade = £1000 × 0.0025 = £2.50
```

**Monthly Projections:**

| Users | Avg Trades/Month | Avg Trade Size | Monthly Volume | Monthly Revenue (0.25%) |
|-------|------------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| 100   | 20               | £500           | £1,000,000     | £2,500                  |
| 500   | 20               | £500           | £5,000,000     | £12,500                 |
| 1,000 | 20               | £500           | £10,000,000    | £25,000                 |
| 5,000 | 20               | £500           | £50,000,000    | £125,000                |
| 10,000| 20               | £500           | £100,000,000   | £250,000                |

**Conservative Estimate (1,000 users):** £25,000/month = £300,000/year

#### 2. Deposit Fees (Optional - currently 0%)
We could charge:
- Card deposits: 2.5% (industry standard)
- Bank transfer: Free (competitive advantage)

**If implemented:**
- 1,000 users × £100 avg deposit/month × 2.5% = £2,500/month
- Annual: £30,000

**Decision:** Keep FREE for competitive advantage, grow user base faster

#### 3. Withdrawal Fees (Currently minimal)
- Free for bank transfers under £1,000
- £2 fee for amounts under £100
- 1% for crypto withdrawals (if implemented)

**Projected:**
- 1,000 users × 2 withdrawals/month × £2 avg = £4,000/month
- Annual: £48,000

#### 4. Staking Commission (10% of rewards)
- Users stake crypto, earn 8% APY
- We take 10% of rewards = 0.8% annual commission on staked amount

**If £5M staked:**
- User earns: 8% APY
- We earn: 0.8% = £40,000/year

#### 5. Premium Features (Future)
- API access for bots: £50/month
- Advanced analytics: £20/month
- Institutional accounts: Custom pricing

**Projected (100 premium users):**
- £50 × 100 = £5,000/month = £60,000/year
