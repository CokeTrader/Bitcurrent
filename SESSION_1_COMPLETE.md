## 🚀 HOW TO CONTINUE

### Option 1: Keep Building (Recommended)
**I continue across multiple sessions:**
- Session 2: Authentication & real-time data
- Session 3-4: Advanced trading features
- Session 5-6: Web3 integration
- Session 7-8: Staking & DeFi
- Session 9-10: Testing & polish
- **Result**: Beta launch in 5-6 weeks

### Option 2: Get Figma Designs First
**Pause coding, focus on design:**
1. Give FIGMA_DESIGN_PROMPT.md to designer
2. Get professional mockups (1-2 weeks)
3. Resume coding with visual reference
- **Result**: More polished, takes longer

### Option 3: MVP Launch
**Ship what we have, iterate:**
1. Deploy current version as "preview"
2. Gather user feedback
3. Build features based on demand
- **Result**: Faster validation, less features
