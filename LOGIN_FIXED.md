# âœ… Login Issue Fixed

## Problem
The website was showing "network error and cannot connect to server" when trying to log in.

## Root Cause
The **API Gateway** service was not running. While the infrastructure services (PostgreSQL, Redis) were running, the backend API service that handles authentication requests was not started.

## Solution Applied
Started the API Gateway service on port 8080:
```bash
cd services/api-gateway && ./main
```

## Current System Status

### âœ… Services Running
- **PostgreSQL** (port 5432) - Database âœ“
- **Redis** (port 6379) - Cache âœ“
- **API Gateway** (port 8080) - Backend API âœ“
- **Frontend** (port 3000) - Next.js App âœ“

### âœ… Verified Working
1. Health check endpoint: `http://localhost:8080/health`
2. Markets endpoint: `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/markets`
3. User registration: Working âœ“
4. User login: Working âœ“

## Demo Account Created

For testing, a demo account has been created:

- **Email**: `demo@bitcurrent.com`
- **Password**: `DemoPassword123!`

You can now log in with these credentials on the website at `http://localhost:3000`

## How to Access

1. **Website**: http://localhost:3000
2. **API**: http://localhost:8080
3. **Grafana**: http://localhost:3001

## What to Do Next

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click "Sign In" or go to the login page
3. Enter the demo credentials above
4. You should now be able to log in successfully!

## Note on Password Requirements
- Passwords must be **at least 12 characters**
- Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters for security

## Keeping Services Running

The API Gateway is currently running in the background. If you need to restart it later:

```bash
cd /Users/poseidon/Monivo/Bitcurrent/Bitcurrent1/services/api-gateway
./main
```

Or use the Makefile commands for a complete setup:
```bash
make infra-up    # Start infrastructure services
make dev         # Start complete development environment
```
