## ✅ Issues You Found & Fixed

### 1. **Login Not Working**
**Problem**: "Network error and cannot connect to server"  
**Root Cause**: API Gateway wasn't running  
**Fixed**: Started API Gateway on port 8080 ✅

### 2. **Redirect Loop After Login**
**Problem**: "After signing in, redirects me to login page again"  
**Root Cause**: Token saved in localStorage, but middleware checked for cookie  
**Fixed**: Added session_token cookie on login ✅

### 3. **Weird Logo**
**Problem**: "BitCurrent logo looks weird in navbar"  
**Fixed**: Reverted to clean text-based logo ✅

### 4. **Double Navbar**
**Problem**: "Navbar starts duplicating when I press certain buttons"  
**Root Cause**: Header rendered in layout.tsx AND in each page  
**Fixed**: Removed duplicate Headers from all 8+ pages ✅

### 5. **Fake Data on NEW Accounts**
**Problem**: "Why does a completely new account have placeholder values instead of real value, i.e 0.0"  
**Examples**: £24k portfolio, 0.42 BTC, "Best Performer", "1,247 trades"  
**Fixed**: ALL fake data removed, shows £0.00 everywhere ✅

### 6. **Fake £5,000 Balance**
**Problem**: "How do you have 5000£ in a NEW account"  
**Fixed**: Changed default balance to £0.00 ✅

### 7. **Fake "80% in 2 assets"**
**Problem**: "How is 80% of portfolio in 2 assets" (when portfolio is £0!)  
**Fixed**: Removed this tip, replaced with "Getting Started" ✅

### 8. **Fake Open Orders**
**Problem**: "Why is there open orders already"  
**Fixed**: Changed openOrders to empty array [] ✅

### 9. **Fake Chart Growth**
**Problem**: "Why does the graph look like that, it should reflect the value... not fake random numbers"  
**Fixed**: Chart now shows flat line at £0.00 ✅

### 10. **Missing KYC/Deposit**
**Problem**: "Why isnt there any option for KYC and depositing money"  
**Fixed**: Created KYC page + enhanced Deposit page ✅

### 11. **No Withdraw Page**
**Problem**: "There is nothing in the deposit and withdraw page"  
**Fixed**: Created complete Withdraw page ✅

### 12. **No Account Deletion**
**Problem**: "Implement a way users can delete their account"  
**Fixed**: Settings page with Danger Zone + backend API ✅

### 13. **Missing Tax Feature**
**Problem**: "You didn't implement the tax feature we talked about earlier"  
**Fixed**: Complete Tax Center with HMRC-verified information ✅

### 14. **Inaccurate Tax Rates**
**Problem**: "Make sure to research to gather verified information"  
**Fixed**: Researched HMRC sources, corrected rates to 18%/24% ✅
