# ✅ All UX Improvements Complete!

## Summary of Fixes

I've successfully implemented all the improvements you requested! Here's what's been fixed:

## 1. ✅ Fixed BitCurrent Logo

**Problem**: Logo looked weird with gradient text rendering issues

**Solution**: 
- Created a proper logo with icon + text
- Added a circular "B" badge with gradient background

**Solution**:
