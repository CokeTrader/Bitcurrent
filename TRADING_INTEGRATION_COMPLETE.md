# ✅ Trading Integration Complete - All Updates Flow Through

## What I Fixed

### 1. ✅ Chart Time Intervals Now Update
**Problem**: Clicking different time intervals didn't update the chart  
**Solution**: Added regeneration logic when interval changes  
**Result**: Chart now refreshes when you click 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d ✅

### 2. ✅ Removed £5,000 Balance
**Problem**: Trade page still showed fake £5,000 GBP balance  
**Location**: `page.tsx` line 314 had hardcoded `quote: 5000`  
**Fixed**: Changed to `quote: 0.00` for NEW accounts ✅

### 3. ✅ Buy Green / Sell Red Hover
**Problem**: Buy/Sell buttons didn't have proper hover colors  
**Solution**: Added hover states:
- **Buy button**: Hovers to green (`hover:bg-success/10 hover:text-success`)
- **Sell button**: Hovers to red (`hover:bg-destructive/10 hover:text-destructive`)
**Result**: Clear visual feedback when hovering ✅

### 4. ✅ Full Order Integration
**Problem**: Placing order didn't update balances, portfolio, history, etc.  
**Solution**: Created comprehensive trading store with Zustand  
**Result**: Everything updates when you place an order! ✅
