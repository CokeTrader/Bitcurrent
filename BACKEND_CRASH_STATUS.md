# Backend Crash Status - Critical Issue

## Problem Summary
Railway backend continues to return 502 errors despite environment variables being added.

## Root Cause Identified
**Error**: `TypeError: OAuth2Strategy requires a clientID option`  
**Location**: `/app/node_modules/passport-oauth2/lib/strategy.js:87`

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Missing Environment Variables ✅
Added to Railway (confirmed visible in Variables tab):
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` = (client ID from Google Console)
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` = (client secret from Google Console)

Variable count increased from 15 to 17 (confirmed).

### 2. Added Passport Initialization to server.js ✅
**Commit**: `168daf3` - "fix: initialize passport middleware to enable Google OAuth"
- Added `express-session` to dependencies
- Added session middleware
- Added `passport.initialize()` and `passport.session()`

### 3. Triggered Redeploy ✅
**Commit**: `2d2beb3` - "trigger: force Railway redeploy with Google OAuth env vars"
- Made code change to force Railway rebuild
- Railway shows "Deployment successful"
- Status: ACTIVE

## Current Status

### What's Working
- ✅ Frontend deployed to Vercel
- ✅ DNS configured (SSL pending)
- ✅ Google OAuth environment variables added to Railway
- ✅ Railway deployment completes successfully
- ✅ Railway shows "ACTIVE" status

### What's NOT Working
- ❌ Backend returns 502 on all requests
- ❌ Health endpoint: `https://bitcurrent-production.up.railway.app/health` returns 502
- ❌ Application crashes at runtime (not build-time)

## Deployment Timeline
- 02:32:57 - Crash with "OAuth2Strategy requires clientID" error
- 02:40:26 - Same error (before env vars added)
- Latest: "trigger: force Railway redeploy" - Deployed 2 minutes ago, still 502

## Possible Remaining Issues

### Theory 1: Environment Variable Not Loading
The env vars are SET in Railway but the Node.js process might not be reading them correctly.

**Check**: 
- Verify `process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is actually available at runtime
- May need to restart the service (not just redeploy)

### Theory 2: Crash Loop Before Env Vars Take Effect
The app might be crashing so fast that the env vars don't get loaded.

**Solution**: 
- May need to temporarily comment out passport initialization
- Deploy without OAuth
- Then add it back once stable

### Theory 3: Different Error Now
Since we can't see the latest logs (Railway UI issues), there might be a new error.

**Check**: Need to see logs from the deployment at ~01:44 AM (2 minutes ago)

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Check Latest Logs** (Need Railway access):
   - Go to Railway → Bitcurrent service → Deployments
   - Click on "trigger: force Railway redeploy..." deployment
   - View logs to see actual runtime error

2. **Verify Env Vars in Runtime**:
   Add temporary logging to `config/passport.js`:
   ```javascript
   console.log('GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID:', process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID ? 'SET' : 'NOT SET');
   console.log('GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET:', process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET ? 'SET' : 'NOT SET');
   ```

3. **Emergency Workaround** (if needed):
   Temporarily disable Google OAuth to get backend working:
   - Comment out passport initialization in `server.js`
   - Comment out Google OAuth routes in `routes/auth.js`
   - Deploy to get basic functionality back
   - Debug OAuth separately

4. **Alternative: Make Passport Optional**:
   Wrap passport initialization in try-catch:
   ```javascript
   try {
     if (process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID && process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET) {
       const passport = require('./config/passport');
       app.use(passport.initialize());
       app.use(passport.session());
     } else {
       console.warn('Google OAuth disabled: missing credentials');
     }
   } catch (error) {
     console.error('Passport initialization failed:', error.message);
   }
   ```

## Files Modified (All Commits Pushed)

1. `backend-broker/server.js` - Added passport initialization
2. `backend-broker/package.json` - Added express-session dependency
3. `backend-broker/config/passport.js` - Google OAuth strategy (already existed)
4. `frontend/hooks/use-websocket-price.ts` - Live exchange rate integration
5. `frontend/lib/api/exchange-rate.ts` - New file for live GBP/USD rates

## What User Needs to Do

**Option A: Check Logs Manually**
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on Bitcurrent service
3. Click on latest deployment ("trigger: force Railway redeploy...")
4. View full logs
5. Share what the actual error is NOW (might be different)

**Option B: Emergency Deploy Without OAuth**
If you want the backend working ASAP, I can:
1. Comment out all Google OAuth code
2. Deploy a working version without OAuth
3. Add OAuth back later once debugged

**Option C: Wait for Railway**
Sometimes Railway takes 2-3 minutes after "Deployment successful" to actually start serving. We could wait 5 more minutes and try again.

## My Assessment

The fixes are correct, but something is preventing the env vars from being available to the Node.js process at runtime. This is likely either:
1. A Railway platform issue (caching old deployment)
2. A timing issue (app crashes before env vars load)
3. A new different error we can't see yet

I need either:
- Access to see the actual latest logs, OR
- Permission to deploy a workaround (disable OAuth temporarily)
