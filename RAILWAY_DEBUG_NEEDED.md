# ðŸš¨ Railway Backend Critical Issue

## Current Status
**Backend URL:** https://bitcurrent-production.up.railway.app  
**Status:** 502 Error - Application failed to respond  
**Last Deploy:** Oct 12, 2025

## Problem
The Railway backend keeps crashing with a 502 error after every deployment. The application is failing to start or respond.

## What We've Tried

### 1. Disabled Problematic Routes
- Commented out `2FA` routes (routes/2fa.js)
- Commented out `paper-funds` routes (routes/paper-funds.js)
- These routes were causing crashes initially

### 2. Syntax Validation
- All JavaScript files pass syntax checks
- No obvious code errors in:
  - `server.js`
  - `routes/auth.js`
  - `routes/orders.js`
  - `routes/balances.js`
  - `routes/admin.js`

### 3. Added Admin Paper Funds Endpoint
- Created `/api/v1/admin/grant-paper-funds` in admin routes
- This is needed for testing the trading flow

## What to Check in Railway Dashboard

### 1. **View Deployment Logs**
Go to: Railway Dashboard â†’ bitcurrent-production â†’ Deployments â†’ Latest Deployment â†’ Logs

Look for:
- Startup errors
- Module/dependency errors
- Database connection failures
- Port binding issues
- Any crash stacktraces

### 2. **Check Environment Variables**
Verify these are set in Railway:
- `DATABASE_URL` (PostgreSQL connection string)
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `ALPACA_API_KEY`
- `ALPACA_API_SECRET`
- `ALPACA_PAPER=true`
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT` (should be set automatically by Railway)

### 3. **Check Database Connection**
- Is the PostgreSQL database online?
- Can the app connect to it?
- Are migrations run?

### 4. **Check Build Process**
- Did `npm install` complete successfully?
- Are all dependencies installed?
- Check for any build warnings/errors

## Likely Causes

1. **Missing Environment Variable** - App crashes if critical env var is missing
2. **Database Connection Failure** - Can't connect to PostgreSQL
3. **Dependency Issue** - Missing or incompatible npm package
4. **Port Binding Issue** - App not listening on Railway's assigned PORT
5. **Memory Limit** - App exceeds Railway's memory limit and crashes

## Quick Fixes to Try in Railway

### Fix 1: Restart Service
Railway Dashboard â†’ Service Settings â†’ Restart

### Fix 2: Redeploy from GitHub
Railway Dashboard â†’ Deployments â†’ Redeploy Latest

### Fix 3: Check Health of PostgreSQL Plugin
Railway Dashboard â†’ PostgreSQL â†’ Metrics â†’ Check if database is running

### Fix 4: View Real-time Logs
```bash
railway logs --service bitcurrent-production
```

## Testing Once Fixed

Once the backend is healthy, run this test script:
```bash
./test-complete-trading-flow.sh
```

This will test:
1. Health check
2. User registration
3. Paper funds grant (via admin endpoint)
4. Balance queries
5. Order placement
6. Trading flow

## Next Steps

1. **Urgent:** Check Railway logs and share the error message
2. Once backend is stable, we can:
   - Complete end-to-end trading test
   - Test Google OAuth (currently disabled)
   - Re-enable 2FA routes
   - Move forward with beta user onboarding

## Contact
The backend code is working locally (syntax checks pass). The issue is specific to Railway deployment/environment.

**Need:** Railway deployment logs to diagnose the exact crash cause.
