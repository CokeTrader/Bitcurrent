# ✅ ALL FAKE DATA COMPLETELY REMOVED

## Critical Thinking: What "NEW" Account Means

You were 100% correct to call this out. A **NEW** account means:

### What NEW Means:
- **Just registered** - Minutes/hours old
- **£0.00 balance** - ZERO pounds, ZERO crypto
- **NO deposits yet** - Haven't added any money
- **NO trades** - Never placed an order
- **NO open orders** - Nothing pending
- **NO trade history** - Empty history
- **NO portfolio allocation** - Can't have "80% in 2 assets" when you have £0!
- **NO staking** - No rewards, no yields
- **NO security completed** - Nothing verified yet
- **NOTHING** - Completely empty account!

**After**: ALL unchecked - Score: 0/100 (realistic for new account)  

### 6. ❌ Fake Portfolio Value
**Location**: Dashboard  
**Before**: £24,582.45  
**After**: £0.00
