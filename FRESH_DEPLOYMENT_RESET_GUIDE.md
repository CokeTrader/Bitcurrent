## üÜò TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Vercel build fails"
```bash
# Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
# Common issues:
- Missing environment variables
- TypeScript errors
- Module not found

# Fix:
- Add missing env vars
- Check frontend/package.json has all dependencies
- Trigger manual redeploy
```

### "Railway won't start"
```bash
# Check Railway logs
# Common issues:
- Missing DATABASE_URL
- Port binding error
- Module not found

# Fix:
- Ensure PostgreSQL is attached
- Check all env vars present
- npm install ran successfully
```

### "DNS still not working"
```bash
# Check DNS propagation:
nslookup bitcurrent.co.uk

# If still returns NXDOMAIN:
- Wait longer (up to 24 hours globally)
- Flush local DNS: sudo dscacheutil -flushcache (Mac)
- Try different network/incognito
- Use bitcurrent.vercel.app in meantime
```

### "Stripe checkout fails"
```
# Check Railway logs for errors
# Ensure:
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY is set
- STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET is set
- Webhook endpoint configured in Stripe dashboard
- Test with: node scripts/test-stripe.js
```
