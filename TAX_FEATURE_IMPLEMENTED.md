## 📊 Tax Calculation Logic

### Capital Gains Formula:
```
Gain/Loss = Proceeds - Cost Basis

Where:
- Proceeds = Sale price × Amount sold
- Cost Basis = Purchase price × Amount sold

Example:
- Buy 1 BTC at £40,000 (cost basis)
- Sell 1 BTC at £45,000 (proceeds)
- Gain = £45,000 - £40,000 = £5,000
```

### Tax Calculation:
```
Taxable Amount = Net Gain - Annual Allowance
Tax Due = Taxable Amount × Tax Rate

Example (2024-25):
- Net Gain: £5,000
- Allowance: £3,000
- Taxable: £5,000 - £3,000 = £2,000
- Tax (20%): £2,000 × 0.20 = £400
```
