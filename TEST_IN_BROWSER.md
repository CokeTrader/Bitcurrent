## üîç Why You Can't See Changes

### Issue: Browser Cache
**Problem:** Your browser cached the old version  
**Solution:** Hard reload or incognito window

### Issue: Vercel Build Time
**Problem:** Vercel takes 1-2 minutes to rebuild  
**Solution:** Wait 2 minutes, then hard reload

### Issue: DNS Cache
**Problem:** Your computer cached old DNS  
**Solution:** 
```bash
# Flush DNS cache (Mac)
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder

# Flush DNS (Windows)
ipconfig /flushdns
```
