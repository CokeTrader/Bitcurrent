# ðŸš¨ URGENT: AWS Access Key Exposed - Fix Immediately

## What Happened
Your AWS access key was accidentally saved in a file. Even though we removed it, you should rotate it immediately as a security best practice.

## Fix It Now (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Deactivate the Exposed Key
```bash
# Option A: Via AWS Console (Easiest)
1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/
2. Click "Users" â†’ Select your admin user
3. Click "Security credentials" tab
4. Find the access key starting with: j8yL9E3ozLWG...
5. Click "Actions" â†’ "Deactivate"
6. Then "Actions" â†’ "Delete"

# Option B: Via AWS CLI (if already configured)
aws iam list-access-keys --user-name bitcurrent-admin
aws iam delete-access-key --user-name bitcurrent-admin --access-key-id AKIAXXXXXXXX
```

### Step 2: Create New Access Key
```bash
1. Same page (IAM â†’ Users â†’ Your user â†’ Security credentials)
2. Click "Create access key"
3. Download the CSV file (save it securely!)
4. Click "Done"
```

### Step 3: Update AWS CLI Configuration
```bash
# Reconfigure AWS CLI with NEW credentials
aws configure

# It will prompt you:
AWS Access Key ID [****************]: [Paste NEW key]
AWS Secret Access Key [****************]: [Paste NEW secret]
Default region name [eu-west-2]: eu-west-2
Default output format [json]: json

# Verify it works
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

## âœ… After This
Your AWS account is secure again. Delete this file once done:
```bash
rm /Users/poseidon/Monivo/Bitcurrent/Bitcurrent1/SECURITY_FIX_REQUIRED.md
```

## Security Best Practices Going Forward
- âœ… NEVER put credentials in files (use environment variables or AWS CLI config)
- âœ… NEVER commit credentials to git
- âœ… Use AWS CLI config: `~/.aws/credentials` (automatically created by `aws configure`)
- âœ… Enable MFA on your AWS account
- âœ… Use IAM roles instead of access keys when possible
