## 📝 Next Steps for Beta Launch

### 1. Create Admin User
Run the script to create an admin account:
```bash
./create-admin-user.sh
```

Then manually promote the user in PostgreSQL:
```sql
UPDATE users SET is_admin = true WHERE id = 'USER_ID_HERE';
```

### 2. Grant Paper Funds
Use admin account to grant £10,000 paper funds to test users:
```bash
curl -X POST https://bitcurrent-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/admin/grant-paper-funds \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId": "USER_ID", "amount": 10000}'
```

### 3. Complete Trading Flow Test
```bash
./test-complete-trading-flow.sh
```

This will test:
- ✅ User registration
- ✅ Paper funds grant
- ✅ Balance queries
- ⏳ Buy order placement
- ⏳ Balance verification
- ⏳ 2FA setup

### 4. Test Google OAuth
- Navigate to `/auth/login`
- Click "Sign in with Google"
- Verify callback and token storage
- Check dashboard redirection

### 5. DNS Propagation Check
Wait for DNS to fully propagate (up to 48 hours):
```bash
dig bitcurrent.co.uk
nslookup bitcurrent.co.uk
curl -I https://bitcurrent.co.uk
```

### 6. Beta User Onboarding
Once everything is tested:
1. Share `bitcurrent.co.uk` with 10 beta users
2. Provide them with instructions
3. Monitor Railway logs for errors
4. Collect feedback via email/form
5. Fix issues within 24 hours

### 7. Public Launch
After beta testing:
1. Post on Reddit r/BitcoinUK
2. Share on Twitter
3. Submit to crypto directories
4. Monitor traffic with Vercel Analytics
