### Option 1: Bootstrap (Recommended)

**Required Capital**: Â£200,000

- Founders: Â£50-100k
- Friends & Family: Â£50-100k
- Revenue from Month 4+: Self-sustaining

**Pros**:

- Full control
- Lower pressure
- Profitable Year 2

**Cons**:
- Slower growth
- Limited marketing budget
- Higher personal risk

### Option 2: Angel/Seed Round

**Raise**: Â£500k-1M at Â£2-3M pre-money valuation

**Use of Funds**:
- Â£200k: Startup costs (above)
- Â£200k: Marketing & growth
- Â£100k: Team expansion
- Â£100k: Runway buffer

**Pros**:
- Faster growth
- Professional guidance
- Network effects
- Marketing budget

**Cons**:

- Board dynamics

### Option 3: Hybrid

**Best of Both Worlds**:
- Prove model first (higher valuation)
- Keep majority equity
