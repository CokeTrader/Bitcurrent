⏸️ WHAT'S BLOCKED (Requires Your Manual Action)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

These tasks CANNOT be automated (security verifications):

1. Deploy to Vercel (15 min)
   - Need email verification code
   - Sign up → Connect GitHub → Deploy
   
2. Deploy to Railway (15 min)
   - Need email/GitHub OAuth
   - Sign up → Connect repo → Add PostgreSQL

3. Update DNS (5 min)
   - Point bitcurrent.co.uk to Vercel
   - Point api.bitcurrent.co.uk to Railway

4. Pay ICO Registration (5 min)
   - £40 payment
